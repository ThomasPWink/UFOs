## Summary
The current format has a major drawback that items will not return unless they are an exact match, this includes format and case sensitive.  Two recommendations for further development would be to include a search range for dates, this can allow someone to search for similar sightings close to each other.  The other would be to include a button that allows you to search any or all search criteria based on the users preference.
